# AR-3D-Drawing

AR Drawing++ is an augmented reality (AR) tool built in Unity that allows users to create their own textures and use them to build a 3D world. With the app, users can draw or paint their own textures using a variety of brush styles and colors. Once they have created their texture, they can then use it to create 3D objects and environments within the AR world.
